                The movie starts from a small village of Chambal district in Madhya pradesh. The movie starts from a
                small house a father his daughter his two elder sons his old mother and wife. In starting we see Manoj
                Kumar Sharma making cheats for his 12th examination.<br><br>

                There came a friend of Manoj Kumar Sharma's father who works with him in his office with a suspension
                letter of Manoj Kumar's father, which his father denies to take. Upon asking by the grandmother the
                friend of Manoj Kumar's father tells that he didn't signed a paper which was given by the vidhayak of
                the village which was a wrong doing, and even slapped the chairman with his slippers.<br><br>

                The colleague left his home after pasting this suspension letter on the wall. The next scene is opens in
                a classroom of 12th board examination where all the students are gathered to give the examination,
                because they are failed several times and due to the school belongs to the vidhayak ji of the village
                the vidhayak ji made a facility for all the student so that they can pass, the teacher is writing
                answers on the board and the students are copying it. Meanwhile there came a honest DSP into the class
                and so what is happening there he went to the principal's office where the principal is bribing him. DSP
                arrest the principal of the school with the bribe amount and have a photograph of it.<br><br>

                Next we came to know that Manoj Kumar and his brother are again failed, their father is going to fight
                against the corruption. He left the home with a warmed heart and giving tears in all his family
                members.<br><br>

                Manoj Kumar and his brother have made a jugaad so that they can have a little amount of money to run
                their house. They again went in a difficulty when there 'jugaad' a transport vehicle was stopped by the
                goons of vidhayak ji and the both were arrested by a corrupt police officer. While having a long
                conversation between the corrupt policeman and Manoj Kumar Manoj Kumar was released so that he can have
                his gun to kill the police officer.<br><br>

                But he did work from his mind he went to the honest DSP quarter and explained the all scene to him. As
                Manoj was talking to him like a mature guy the DSP agreed on going with him to the police station. Upon
                reaching there he give orders to corrupt police officer to release Manoj Kumar's brother. While on their
                way to their home they were given lift by the DSP there he came to know that Manoj Kumar was one of the
                Student of the school where he stopped cheating, he taught Manoj Kumar that cheating is wrong you have
                to do hardwork and took promise not to cheat anymore.<br><br>

                Manoj Kumar was impressed by the DSP's power as he also want to be a powerful police officer, so he went
                outside the village to complete his graduation in BA. After completing his degree he went to home and
                said to his mother that he want to do PCS training, his grandmother gave all his lifetime pension amount
                to him and said not to tell anyone that what she has given to him. He pick up a bus from his village to
                Alwar after reaching the Alwar bus stand he was waken up by the conductor he was shocked to know that
                his bag and his all necessary things are stolen. He enquired with the conductor and go to know that the
                lady sitting beside him has taken the bag 30 minutes earlier. Now everything was running in Manoj's mind
                as he lost the money given by his grandmother he had no rent to pay for the PG he has no money for the
                coaching. He came to know that PCS exam has been cancelled for 2 years.<br><br>

                He survived with hunger many days outside a restaurant, but one day his hunger was uncontrollable and he
                went to the restaurant and asked to have some food the restaurant owner gave him food he asked the
                restaurant owner to tell some work so that he can pay for the food he given to him, but the restaurant
                owner denied upon insisting the restaurant owner again and again a voice came "bhai main de dunga" the
                voice was of Pritam Pandey who was also an aspirant of PCS.<br><br>

                But now Pritam Pandey is going to Delhi Mukherjee Nagar for the preparation of UPSC to become either IPS
                or a IAS officer, Manoj also wanted Pritam to take him to Delhi. Pritam said yes to Manoj and they both
                came to Delhi.<br><br>

                The next day they went to Gauri bhaiya who was also in aspirant of UPSC and had gone till the last
                interview but his fortune has decided something else after losing all his attempts he started giving
                motivation to other aspirants of UPSC and getting them to restart in life. Upon seeing Gauri bhaiya last
                attempt failed Pritam switched to a english coaching centre and Manoj is still with Gauri
                bhaiya.<br><br>

                In the prelims of UPSC Manoj failed but Pritam qualifies the prelims of UPSC, but later fails in mains
                of UPSC. As Manoj was also doing part time jobs he went to Pritam Pandey's coaching to serve tea there
                he met with Deepak Mohan who recently qualified UPSC and became an IPS officer, Deepak Mohan gave his
                word to Manoj Kumar that whenever he want him just come do not hesitate.<br><br>

                Upon finding various coaching centres at last Manoj Kumar joined a library for part time job and joined
                a coaching centre.<br><br>

                His story make a turn when he mets with Shraddha who was also a UPSC aspirant and she misunderstood
                Manoj as a aeronautical engineer even Manoj didn't even tell her about him as now he has a small corner
                in his heart for her and he afraid that if he clears the misunderstanding she will leave him.<br><br>

                They started to spent time together they started studying together. One more turn came in his life when
                one day a topic of aeronautical engineering was being taught in the class and Shraddha raised her hand
                that Manoj is a aeronautical engineer and is being hesitating to answer the question.<br><br>

                That time Shraddha came to know that Manoj is not a aeronautical engineer he is just a BA pass, without
                telling anything to Manoj Kumar she went to her house in Mussoorie for the prelims of UPSC, Manoj again
                failed in his third attempt.<br><br>

                After getting failed in his third attempt and after being left by Shraddha he went to Mussoorie to meet
                Shraddha at his home there he got to know that she is gone to attend a wedding at her paternal aunt's
                house but was helped by the house worker of shraddha's home to talk Shraddha on the mobile phone.
                Shraddha asked Manoj that why did he came to her house not focusing on his ambition he has to restart.
                At this point of time Manoj also went to his village where he came to know that his grandmother is no
                more and upon asking her mother why didn't she told him he go to know that her grandmother didn't want
                to see him in tension.<br><br>

                Manoj came back to Delhi he has a short violent with the librarian and left the library after lefting
                the library he went to work in a atta chakki there he works 12 to 14 hours and in night he used to study
                under a single lamp.One day Gauri bhaiya came at Manoj's atta chakki with Manoj's father he was
                overwhelmed after seeing his father, both father and son had a decision. He cleared the prelims of 4th
                attempt then one day he met to Shraddha in his classroom again he failed in his main's attempt while
                writing an essay on tourism of India which he misunderstood as terrorism in India.<br><br>

                He went to Deepak Mohan who is now and IPS officer he gave his time to Manoj Kumar. He gave Manoj Manoj
                Kumar an essay to write and the topic was Manoj Kumar Sharma he was not able to write 80 to 90 words in
                8 minutes 20 seconds. Deepak Mohan said Manoj Kumar that UPSC is not for him.<br><br>

                Disappointed Manoj Kumar came to Gauri bhaiya's tea stall being sitting with Shraddha. Their came
                drunken Pritam Pandey who was also failed in his prelims this time also and was devastated to see both
                of them together he advised Manoj Kumar that this girl Shraddha will ruin his life she will not look at
                her if he is not successful, filled with shame Shraddha leaved the place Manoj followed her pleased her
                not to go upon which Shraddha opened her heart's voice she proposed Manoj and asked him to disarray the
                whole world.<br><br>

                Manoj came to his atta chakki and starting studying, Gauri bhaiya helped Manoj by giving him his room
                and taking care of all the facilities sending money to Manoj's home , Shraddha cleared her prelims and
                now she is going to Mussoorie again for her mains exam. After sometime Manoj came to know from Shraddha
                that she cleared the interview and now is a deputy collector.<br><br>

                Manoj was overwhelmed by the success of Shraddha and is now double motivated. His last attempted Manoj
                cleared prelims as well as mains. Pritam Pandey fails in his last attempt and was angry on Manoj's
                success. Shraddha wants to come to Delhi but was stopped by her father as her father came to know from a
                unknown that her daughter has shared bed with Manoj kumar. Upon knowing the whole trick Manoj kumar
                called Pritam pandey the call was picked up by a police officer in hurry Manoj Kumar reached the police
                station he saw Pritam beside the bars, there he taught a lesson to the dishonest police officer. After
                leaving the station Manoj checked Pritam's mobile Manoj was right that Pritam was the one who called at
                shraddha's home he devastated Pritam by his words.<br><br>

                Shraddha's parents agreed on her wish to go to Delhi. She came to Delhi and went for the interview with
                Manoj, she gave him a letter which Manoj have to read in alone.<br><br>

                Manoj entered the interview room his 12 compartment gave a great impact on all the interviewers they
                said Manoj to wait for 2 minutes outside, he read the letter Shraddha was asking her to marry him either
                he becomes the IPS or not.<br><br>

                He was again called inside some questions were asked and he was asked to leave.<br><br>

                On the result day he was not sure that will his name comes in the list or not, but he did it his name
                came in the list. Gauri bhaiya was overwhelmed, Pritam pandey becomes a reporter, his whole family is
                happy.<br><br>

                gave his 1st weeding invitation to him. DSP was able to recognise who he is but when recognised he
                hugged him.<br><br>
